<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

Hey! I decided to create a library designed to simplify file type detection. By utilizing magic numbers to identify file types within your C# projects you can safely determine file types,
rather than relying on file extensions which can be changed. 

By using this you instead check against a database of known byte sequences to get the mime type of specific files. The library is designed to work with filestreams, memorystreams and a byte array for ease of use. And you can even add your own custom byte arrays.

Whether you're working on file upload validation, data parsing, or simply need to know the nature of a file, you can always reliably check using this library.



### Built With

* [![DotNet][.Net]][.Net-url]
* [![C#][CSharp]][CSharp-url]



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Simply pull the [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Martin.FileTools.MagicNumberAnalyzer) package from within Visual Studio and use the static `MagicNumberAnalyzer.GetFileMimeType()` method.

## Default filetypes

The following filetypes are registered by default:

```
.7z: application/x-7z-compressed
.avi: video/x-msvideo
.flv: video/x-flv
.m4v: video/x-m4v
.mp4: video/mp4
.svg: image/svg+xml
.pdf: application/pdf
.mp3: audio/mpeg
.wav: audio/wav
.gif: image/gif
.webm: video/webm
.webp: image/webp
.mov: video/quicktime
.png: image/png
.gz: application/gzip
.bmp: image/bmp
.ico: image/x-icon
.jpg: image/jpeg
.zip: application/zip
.rar: application/vnd.rar
.exe: application/x-msdownload
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The library exposes a few structs, properties and methods which allow you to detect known file types but also register your own. As mentioned in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section to simply check a file against the registered list of magic numbers you can add the necessary using `using Martin.FileTools` and then call the method.

Registering a new known magic number is rather easy but requires some explanation. The way magic numbers work means that sometimes you will need to check different offsets. Let's for example say we have a magic number which is `0x24 0x27 xx xx 0xF1 0xA1 0x41 xx 0xC3` in this case we have different bytes we need to check at different offsets.
To achieve that you need to instantiate and add a new `MagicNumber` struct in the static `CustomMagicNumbers` field of the `MagicNumberAnalyzer`. The `MagicNumber` struct in itself holds a list of byte arrays with an offset which represet the ones we know. In our case that is the first 2 at offset 0, the 3 at offset 4 and the last byte at offset 8. Here's how to do that:

```cs
using Martin.FileTools;
using Martin.FileTools.Constants;
using Martin.FileTools.Structs;

MagicNumberAnalyzer.CustomMagicNumbers.Add(new MagicNumber("Your custom mime type", [new([0x24, 0x27], 0), [new([0xF1, 0xA1, 0x41], 4), [new([0xC3], 8)]));
```

Note that custom types are checked first so you could effectively override the registered types. That is so it doesn't interfere with your own custom magic number functionality.
